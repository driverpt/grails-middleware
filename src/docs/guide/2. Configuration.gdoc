By default the no Middleware ServletFilter will not be created unless at least 1 Middleware is defined/configured.

To define the Middleware Pipeline, all you need to do is use the application.yml configuration and define the classes and the order

Example:

{code}
grails:
    middleware:
        order:
            - com.myapp.AuthenticationMiddleware
            - com.myapp.AuthorizationMiddleware
            - com.myapp.subpackage.SomeRandomMiddleware
{code}
